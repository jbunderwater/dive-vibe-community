# Hilma Hooker

Bonaire's most famous wreck dive featuring a 235-foot freighter that serves as an artificial reef

## Overview
The Hilma Hooker is Bonaire's most iconic wreck dive and one of the Caribbean's most famous dive sites. This 235-foot freighter was originally built in 1951 and sank on September 12, 1984, under mysterious circumstances. The ship now lies on its starboard side at a depth of 90 feet (27 meters), with the top of the wreck at about 60 feet (18 meters). The wreck has become a thriving artificial reef, completely encrusted with coral and home to an incredible variety of marine life. The site is accessible via both shore and boat entry, though boat access is more common due to the distance from shore.

## Site Information

## Marine Life
The Hilma Hooker is teeming with marine life. Large schools of horse-eye jacks, barracuda, and tarpon are commonly seen around the wreck. The coral-encrusted hull provides habitat for countless reef fish, including parrotfish, angelfish, and butterflyfish. Macro life includes cleaner shrimp, arrow crabs, and various nudibranchs. The wreck's interior and exterior are home to large groupers, moray eels, and occasionally nurse sharks. Sea turtles are frequent visitors to the site.

## Dive Profile
The wreck lies at 90 feet, making this an advanced dive. Most divers explore the exterior of the wreck between 60-90 feet. The top of the wreck at 60 feet offers excellent photo opportunities and is accessible to intermediate divers. Advanced divers can penetrate the wreck through several openings, though this requires proper training and equipment. Plan for multiple dives to fully explore this extensive site.

## Entry and Exit
Boat access is the most common method, with dive boats anchoring near the wreck. Shore entry is possible but requires a long surface swim. The wreck is located about 300 yards from shore. Exit is typically via the same method as entry.

## Tips and Recommendations
- This is an advanced dive due to depth and potential currents
- Consider hiring a local guide for your first dive on the wreck
- The best visibility is typically in the morning
- Bring a dive light to explore the wreck's interior
- Look for the ship's wheel, engine room, and cargo holds
- The wreck is completely safe to penetrate with proper training

## Safety Considerations
This is an advanced dive site due to depth and potential currents. Ensure you have proper buoyancy control to avoid damaging the coral-encrusted wreck. Currents can be strong, so check conditions before diving. Wreck penetration requires specialized training and equipment. Always dive within your certification limits.

## Photography
The Hilma Hooker offers exceptional photography opportunities. The coral-encrusted wreck provides dramatic wide-angle shots, while the abundant marine life offers great macro subjects. Natural light penetrates well to the top of the wreck at 60 feet. Bring a dive light for interior shots.
