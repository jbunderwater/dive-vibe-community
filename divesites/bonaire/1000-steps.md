# 1000 Steps

A famous Bonaire dive site featuring a dramatic limestone staircase entry and excellent coral formations

## Overview
1000 Steps is one of Bonaire's most iconic dive sites, named for the limestone staircase that leads down to the entry point. Despite the name, there are actually only 67 steps! This site features a dramatic drop-off that starts at about 15 feet and descends to over 100 feet. The reef is in excellent condition with healthy coral formations, including large brain corals, elkhorn coral, and colorful soft corals. The site is particularly known for its abundance of marine life and excellent visibility.

## Marine Life
1000 Steps is renowned for its diverse marine life. Expect to see large schools of blue tangs, parrotfish, and grunts. The site is also home to sea turtles, eagle rays, and occasionally nurse sharks. Macro life includes cleaner shrimp, arrow crabs, and various nudibranchs. The healthy coral formations provide habitat for countless reef fish species.

## Dive Profile
Start your dive by descending the staircase and entering the water at the sandy area. Swim out to the drop-off, which begins at about 15 feet. The reef wall descends steeply to depths of 100+ feet. Plan your dive to explore the wall at different depths, with most of the marine life found between 30-60 feet. The site is suitable for both recreational and technical diving.

## Entry and Exit
The entry is via a well-maintained limestone staircase (67 steps) that leads down to a small sandy beach. The staircase can be slippery when wet, so use caution. Enter the water from the sandy area and swim out to the drop-off. Exit at the same location, being mindful of the steps when climbing back up.

## Tips and Recommendations
- Arrive early to avoid crowds, as this is one of Bonaire's most popular sites
- The staircase can be challenging with heavy gear - consider making multiple trips
- The best diving is along the wall, not in the sandy areas
- Look for the large brain corals and elkhorn coral formations
- This site is excellent for both wide-angle and macro photography

## Safety Considerations
The staircase can be slippery and challenging with dive gear. Take your time and consider making multiple trips to carry equipment. The drop-off is dramatic, so maintain proper buoyancy control. Be aware of boat traffic in the area, though it's typically light at this location.

## Photography
1000 Steps offers exceptional photography opportunities. The clear water and healthy coral formations make it ideal for wide-angle shots. The abundant marine life provides great subjects for both wide-angle and macro photography. Natural light is best during morning hours when the sun illuminates the reef wall.

Nearby sites include Karpata, La Denia's Leap, and Weber's Joy. All are accessible along the northern coast of Bonaire.
