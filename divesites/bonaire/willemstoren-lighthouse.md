The coral formations provide habitat for cleaner shrimp, arrow crabs, and various nudibranchs. The site also supports healthy populations of moray eels and lobster.

## Dive Profile
Begin your dive by entering from the shore near the lighthouse and swimming out to the drop-off. The site features a dramatic drop-off that starts at about 15 feet and descends steeply to depths of 100+ feet. Most of the interesting marine life and coral formations are found between 30-70 feet along the wall. Plan your dive to explore the wall at different depths, taking time to observe the coral formations and marine life. The steep wall makes this site particularly suitable for wall diving techniques.

## Entry and Exit
Access Willemstoren Lighthouse via a marked entry point near the historic lighthouse at Bonaire's southern tip. The entry area features a rocky shoreline that leads to the reef wall. Enter the water carefully from the rocks and swim out to the drop-off. Exit at the same location, being mindful of the rocky shoreline when approaching. The entry and exit can be challenging due to the rocky terrain, so take your time and use appropriate footwear.

## Tips and Recommendations
- The historic lighthouse makes for a great landmark and photo opportunity
- The rocky entry can be challenging - wear appropriate footwear
- The best diving is along the wall, not in the shallow areas
- Look for the large brain corals and elkhorn coral formations
- This site is excellent for wall diving techniques
- Consider diving during morning hours for the best light conditions
- Be mindful of your buoyancy when diving along the wall

## Safety Considerations
The rocky entry and exit require careful navigation. The steep wall requires good buoyancy control and wall diving experience. Be aware of potential currents along the wall, especially at depth. Maintain proper distance from the coral formations to avoid damage. The site can experience boat traffic, so use a dive flag when appropriate.

## Photography
Willemstoren Lighthouse offers exceptional photography opportunities with its dramatic wall and abundant marine life. The steep drop-off creates impressive wide-angle shots, while the coral formations provide great subjects for macro photography. The historic lighthouse also makes for unique above-water photography opportunities. Natural light is best during morning hours when the sun illuminates the wall.
