## Dive Profile
Begin your dive by entering from the shore and swimming out to the reef. The site features a gradual slope that starts at about 10 feet and descends to depths of 100 feet.

## Entry and Exit
Access Punt Vierkant via a marked entry point along the western coast. The entry area features a sandy bottom that gradually transitions to the reef. Enter the water from the shore and swim out to the reef system. Exit at the same location, being mindful of the coral formations when approaching the shore. The entry and exit are generally straightforward, though conditions can vary depending on weather and sea state.

## Tips and Recommendations
- Check local conditions before diving, as currents can vary
- The best diving is along the reef slope, not in the sandy areas
- Look for the large sea fans and soft coral formations
- This site is excellent for both wide-angle and macro photography
- Consider diving during morning hours for the best light conditions
- Be mindful of your buoyancy to protect the coral formations

## Safety Considerations
Always dive within your certification limits and experience level. Be aware of potential currents, especially during certain tide conditions. Maintain proper buoyancy control to protect the coral formations and avoid contact with marine life. The site can experience boat traffic, so use a dive flag when appropriate.

## Photography
Punt Vierkant offers excellent photography opportunities with its healthy coral formations and abundant marine life. The clear water and good visibility make it ideal for wide-angle shots of the reef and fish schools. The sea fans and soft corals provide great subjects for macro photography. Natural light is best during morning hours when the sun illuminates the reef.
