# Pink Beach

A beautiful dive site on Bonaire's southwestern coast, featuring a stunning pink sand beach and vibrant coral reef

## Overview
Pink Beach is one of Bonaire's most picturesque dive sites, located on the southwestern coast of the island. The site is named for its distinctive pink sand beach, created by the erosion of red coral and shells mixed with white sand. The underwater environment features a gradual slope that leads to a healthy coral reef system with excellent marine life viewing opportunities. The site offers good visibility and is suitable for divers of various experience levels, though intermediate skills are recommended due to the depth and potential currents.

The coral formations provide habitat for cleaner shrimp, arrow crabs, and various nudibranchs. The site also supports healthy populations of moray eels and lobster.

## Dive Profile
Begin your dive by entering from the beautiful pink sand beach and swimming out to the reef. The site features a gradual slope that starts at about 10 feet and descends to depths of 100 feet. Most of the interesting marine life and coral formations are found between 30-60 feet. Plan your dive to explore the reef at different depths, taking time to observe the coral formations and marine life. The site is suitable for recreational diving with appropriate bottom time based on your certification level.

## Entry and Exit
Access Pink Beach via the distinctive pink sand beach along the southwestern coast. The entry area features a sandy bottom that gradually transitions to the reef. Enter the water from the beach and swim out to the reef system. Exit at the same location, being mindful of the coral formations when approaching the shore. The entry and exit are generally straightforward, though conditions can vary depending on weather and sea state.

## Tips and Recommendations
- The pink sand beach makes for a beautiful entry and exit point
- Check local conditions before diving, as currents can vary
- The best diving is along the reef slope, not in the sandy areas
- Look for the healthy coral formations and sea fans
- This site is excellent for both wide-angle and macro photography
- Consider diving during morning hours for the best light conditions
- Be mindful of your buoyancy to protect the coral formations

## Safety Considerations
Always dive within your certification limits and experience level. Be aware of potential currents, especially during certain tide conditions. Maintain proper buoyancy control to protect the coral formations and avoid contact with marine life. The site can experience boat traffic, so use a dive flag when appropriate.

## Photography
Pink Beach offers excellent photography opportunities with its healthy coral formations and abundant marine life. The clear water and good visibility make it ideal for wide-angle shots of the reef and fish schools. The coral formations provide great subjects for macro photography. The pink sand beach also makes for unique above-water photography opportunities. Natural light is best during morning hours when the sun illuminates the reef.
