# Oil Slick Leap

An exciting cliff jump dive site featuring dramatic entry and excellent coral formations

## Overview
Oil Slick Leap is one of Bonaire's most thrilling dive sites, named for the dramatic cliff jump entry that provides an adrenaline rush before the dive even begins. The site features a rocky ledge about 15 feet above the water, from which divers make a giant stride entry. Once in the water, divers are greeted by a beautiful reef wall that starts at about 20 feet and drops steeply to depths of over 100 feet. The reef is in excellent condition with healthy coral formations and abundant marine life. The site is particularly popular with adventurous divers who enjoy the exciting entry.

## Dive Profile
The entry is via a dramatic cliff jump from a rocky ledge about 15 feet above the water. After the giant stride entry, swim out to the reef wall, which starts at about 20 feet. Plan your dive to explore the wall at different depths, with most of the marine life found between 30-60 feet. The dramatic topography makes this site excellent for both recreational and technical diving.

## Entry and Exit
The entry is via a giant stride from a rocky ledge about 15 feet above the water. The ledge is easily accessible and provides a safe jumping point. After the dive, exit at the same location by climbing back up the rocks. The exit can be challenging with dive gear, so take your time.

## Tips and Recommendations
- This site is not for the faint of heart due to the cliff jump entry
- The entry is safe but requires confidence and proper technique
- The best diving is along the wall, not in the sandy areas
- Look for the large brain corals and elkhorn coral formations
- This site is excellent for both wide-angle and macro photography

## Safety Considerations
The cliff jump entry requires confidence and proper technique. The rocky ledge can be slippery when wet, so use caution. The reef wall is dramatic, so maintain proper buoyancy control. The exit can be challenging with dive gear, so take your time. Be aware of boat traffic in the area, though it's typically light at this location.

## Photography
Oil Slick Leap offers exceptional photography opportunities. The dramatic reef wall and healthy coral formations provide excellent wide-angle shots. The abundant marine life offers great subjects for both wide-angle and macro photography. Natural light is best during morning hours when the sun illuminates the reef wall.
