## Mushroom Forest

Mushroom Forest is widely considered one of the Caribbean's most spectacular dive sites and is often featured on lists of the world's top diving destinations. Located off Curaçao's northwest coast near Santa Cruz, this site is famous for its extraordinary coral formations that resemble giant underwater mushrooms. These unique structures were created when disease affected the base of large star corals, leaving the healthy tops supported by narrow stems. The result is a surreal underwater forest of mushroom-shaped corals that creates one of diving's most photographed and memorable experiences. The site's exceptional visibility, diverse marine life, and unique topography make it a must-visit destination for divers visiting Curaçao.
