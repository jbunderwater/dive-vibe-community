## Grote Knip

Grote Knip (Playa Kenepa Grandi) is a spectacular shore dive featuring pristine coral reefs and diverse marine life, adjacent to one of Curaçao's most beautiful beaches.

## Overview

Grote Knip, also known as Playa Kenepa Grandi or Playa Abou, is considered one of Curaçao's premier dive sites, offering exceptional underwater experiences in a breathtaking natural setting. Located just north of its smaller sister site Kleine Knip, this protected bay features a larger diving area with more extensive coral formations and deeper water. The site is renowned for its excellent snorkeling and diving conditions, supported by a well-developed reef system that extends along the bay's perimeter. The combination of easy shore access, diverse marine life, and stunning topside scenery makes this a must-visit destination for divers of all levels.

## Marine Life

Grote Knip supports an exceptional diversity of Caribbean marine life. The healthy coral reef system provides habitat for numerous species of tropical fish including large schools of blue tangs, French grunts, and yellowtail snappers. Regular sightings include green sea turtles, hawksbill turtles, southern stingrays, and nurse sharks. The site is particularly known for its healthy populations of parrotfish, angelfish, and butterflyfish. Macro enthusiasts will find plenty of subjects including flamingo tongues, Christmas tree worms, and various crustaceans. The deeper sections occasionally attract larger pelagic species including barracuda and eagle rays.

## Dive Profile

The dive begins from the sandy beach in shallow water (1-2 meters), making it ideal for beginners and underwater photographers. The reef gradually slopes away from shore, with the most diverse marine life found along the rocky edges and coral formations. The left side of the bay offers excellent coral gardens at depths of 10-20 meters, while the right side features more dramatic topography with steeper slopes reaching 25-30 meters. The outer edges of the bay provide access to deeper water and occasional pelagic encounters. Multiple entry and exit points allow for varied dive profiles and easy surface intervals on the beach.

## Entry and Exit

Entry is convenient from the sandy beach, though the initial underwater terrain includes some coral rubble and rock formations. The entry area is generally sandy with good footing, but reef shoes are recommended for protection. Wade out approximately 20-30 meters before the bottom transitions to coral reef. The beach offers multiple entry points allowing divers to choose the most suitable location based on conditions. Exit is straightforward via the same entry point, with the sandy beach providing easy access back to shore facilities.

## Tips and Recommendations

- Arrive early to secure parking and avoid crowds, especially on weekends
- Bring reef-safe sunscreen and stay hydrated
- Utilize the beach facilities including shade palapas and picnic tables
- Consider renting equipment from the nearby dive operators
- Combine with Kleine Knip for a full day of diving
- Respect the marine park regulations and coral formations

## Safety Considerations

While generally safe, divers should be aware of occasional fishing activities from shore and boat traffic in the outer bay. The shallow reef requires good buoyancy control to prevent coral damage. Weather conditions can change quickly, so check forecasts before diving. The site can experience surge during rough weather, affecting shallow water areas. Always dive with a buddy and consider carrying a surface marker buoy for safety. Emergency services are available through the Curaçao Coast Guard and local dive operators.

## Photography

Grote Knip offers outstanding opportunities for underwater photography with excellent natural lighting and clear water conditions. The diverse coral formations provide excellent wide-angle subjects, while the abundant marine life offers numerous macro opportunities. The site is particularly good for turtle photography and scenic reef shots. The dramatic limestone cliffs and crystal-clear water create opportunities for spectacular over-under photography. Early morning and late afternoon light provide the best conditions for capturing the bay's natural beauty.
