## The Valley

The Valley (Porto Marie) is a unique double reef system offering exceptional diving and snorkeling experiences with its distinctive underwater topography and diverse marine life.

## Overview

The Valley, also known as Porto Marie or Playa Porto Mari, is famous for its unique double reef formation that creates a natural underwater valley between two parallel coral walls. This distinctive topography makes it one of Curaçao's most interesting dive sites, suitable for both beginners and experienced divers. The site features a shallow sandy plateau that gradually descends into the "valley" between the two reefs before dropping off to deeper water. The protected bay location provides excellent conditions year-round, while the diverse underwater landscape supports a rich variety of Caribbean marine life. The combination of shallow areas perfect for snorkeling and deeper sections for advanced diving makes this a versatile destination.

## Marine Life

The Valley's unique double reef structure creates diverse habitats supporting abundant marine life. The sandy valley floor is home to yellow stingrays, garden eels, and various flatfish species. The coral walls host typical Caribbean reef fish including parrotfish, angelfish, wrasses, and butterflyfish. Regular sightings include green sea turtles, hawksbill turtles, and nurse sharks. The site is particularly known for eagle ray encounters, especially near the deeper drop-off areas. Schools of sergeant majors, blue tangs, and yellowtail snappers are common throughout the reef system. Macro life includes Christmas tree worms, flamingo tongues, and various crustaceans hiding in the coral formations.

## Dive Profile

The dive begins from a sandy beach in shallow water (2-3 meters), making it ideal for beginners and certification dives. The initial area features a sandy plateau extending 50-100 meters offshore before reaching the first reef wall. The "valley" between the two reefs offers easy navigation and interesting topography at depths of 8-15 meters. The outer reef wall provides access to deeper water, reaching 25-35 meters for more experienced divers. The site allows for multiple dive profiles, from shallow reef exploration to deeper wall dives, with plenty of marine life at all depths.

## Entry and Exit

Entry is straightforward from the sandy beach at Porto Marie, with minimal coral rubble and good footing. The initial entry area is sandy with gentle slopes, making it suitable for all skill levels. Wade out approximately 30-50 meters before reaching the reef system. The beach offers excellent facilities including restrooms, showers, and equipment rental. Exit is via the same entry point, with the sandy beach providing easy access to shore facilities. The protected bay location ensures calm entry and exit conditions most of the year.

## Tips and Recommendations

- Arrive early to avoid crowds and secure parking
- Bring reef-safe sunscreen and plenty of water
- Take advantage of the beach facilities and restaurant on-site
- Consider combining shallow snorkeling with deeper diving
- Respect the marine park entrance fee (approximately $3 USD)
- Bring an underwater camera for the unique double reef formations

## Safety Considerations

The Valley is generally considered a safe dive site with minimal hazards. The shallow sandy areas require good buoyancy control to avoid stirring up sediment. Be aware of occasional boat traffic in the outer bay areas. Weather conditions can affect visibility and surge, so check forecasts before diving. The site can experience mild currents near the drop-off areas. Always dive with a buddy and consider carrying a surface marker buoy for safety. Emergency services are accessible through the beach facilities and local dive operators.

## Photography

The Valley offers excellent opportunities for underwater photography with its unique double reef topography. The sandy valley floor provides interesting geological formations and contrast with the coral walls. Wide-angle photography captures the unique underwater landscape, while macro photography reveals the diverse small marine life. The site is excellent for capturing rays on the sandy bottom and reef fish along the coral walls. Good natural lighting in the shallow areas makes it ideal for photographers of all skill levels.
