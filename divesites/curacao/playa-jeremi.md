## Marine Life

Playa Jeremi's protected bay and healthy reef system support diverse Caribbean marine life. The site regularly hosts green sea turtles and hawksbill turtles, making it excellent for turtle encounters. The coral formations provide habitat for numerous species of tropical fish including parrotfish, angelfish, butterflyfish, and wrasses. Schools of blue tangs, sergeant majors, and chromis are commonly observed. The site is particularly good for spotting moray eels, octopus, and various crustaceans hiding in the coral formations. The clear water and minimal boat traffic create excellent conditions for observing natural marine behavior.

## Dive Profile

The dive begins from a small rocky beach in shallow water (1-2 meters), making it accessible for divers of all levels. The reef starts immediately offshore, with interesting coral formations beginning at depths of 3-5 meters. The bay gradually deepens toward the center and mouth, reaching maximum depths of 20-25 meters. The compact size of the bay allows for thorough exploration during a single dive, with interesting marine life at all depth levels. The protected nature of the bay ensures calm conditions suitable for leisurely exploration and photography.

## Entry and Exit

Entry is from a small rocky beach area, requiring careful footing due to the rocky substrate. Reef shoes or booties are strongly recommended for protection and traction. The entry area has some coral rubble and rock formations, so careful movement is required. Wade out carefully until you can float comfortably before putting on fins. The compact bay size means the entry/exit point is easily located throughout the dive. Exit requires the same careful attention to the rocky beach area.

## Tips and Recommendations

- Wear reef shoes or sturdy booties for the rocky entry
- Bring an underwater camera for the excellent photography opportunities
- Visit during weekdays for fewer crowds and more peaceful diving
- Pack food and water as facilities are extremely limited
- Combine with nearby Playa Lagun for a full day of diving
- Respect the pristine environment and practice Leave No Trace principles

## Safety Considerations

Playa Jeremi is generally a very safe dive site due to its protected location and calm conditions. The rocky entry requires careful movement to avoid slips or cuts. The remote location means limited immediate access to emergency services, so conservative diving practices are recommended. Weather conditions rarely affect this protected bay, but always check forecasts. The lack of facilities means divers should be self-sufficient with safety equipment and emergency supplies. Always dive with a buddy and inform others of your diving plans.

## Photography

Playa Jeremi offers exceptional underwater photography opportunities with crystal-clear water and excellent natural lighting. The healthy coral formations provide colorful subjects for wide-angle photography, while the abundant marine life offers numerous macro opportunities. The site is particularly good for turtle photography and capturing the natural behavior of marine life in undisturbed conditions. The dramatic limestone cliffs above water create opportunities for spectacular over-under photography combining terrestrial and marine environments.
