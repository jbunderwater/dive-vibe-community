## Ship Wreck Tugboat

The Ship Wreck Tugboat is Curaçao's most famous and accessible wreck dive, featuring a small tugboat in shallow water perfect for beginners and snorkelers of all ages.

## Overview

The Ship Wreck Tugboat, located in Caracasbaai (Caracas Bay), is arguably Curaçao's most iconic and photographed dive site. This small tugboat wreck rests upright in just 5 meters (15 feet) of water, making it accessible to snorkelers, beginner divers, and experienced divers alike. The wreck has been underwater for approximately 30 years and has become completely covered in colorful marine growth, transforming it into a thriving artificial reef. The site's shallow depth, calm conditions, and abundant marine life make it perfect for underwater photography, training dives, and introducing newcomers to wreck diving. The combination of easy accessibility, fascinating artificial reef environment, and spectacular marine life encounters makes this a must-visit destination for anyone diving in Curaçao.

## Marine Life

The Tugboat wreck has become a thriving artificial reef supporting abundant Caribbean marine life. The wreck is famous for its large schools of glassey sweepers that live inside the tugboat's hull, creating spectacular underwater scenes. The coral and sponge-covered structure attracts numerous species of tropical fish including parrotfish, angelfish, butterflyfish, and wrasses. The site is known for regular seahorse sightings, often found clinging to the wreck's structure. Other common encounters include octopus, moray eels, and various species of crabs and shrimp hiding in the wreck's crevices. The shallow depth and artificial reef environment create ideal conditions for observing marine life behavior.

## Dive Profile

The dive begins from a rocky shoreline area near a small pier, with the wreck located just offshore in 5 meters of water. The shallow depth allows for extended bottom times and thorough exploration of the wreck and surrounding area. The tugboat can be completely circumnavigated and explored both inside and out during a single dive. The wreck sits upright on a sandy bottom, with the pilot house partially collapsed but still recognizable. The shallow depth makes it ideal for training dives, underwater photography practice, and snorkeling adventures.

## Entry and Exit

Entry is from a rocky area near a small pier, requiring careful footing due to the uneven terrain. Reef shoes or sturdy booties are recommended for protection and traction. The entry involves navigating over some coral rubble and rocks before reaching the sandy bottom near the wreck. Local dive operators often provide entry guidance and assistance. The wreck is easily located due to its shallow depth and proximity to shore. Exit requires the same careful attention to the rocky entry area.

## Tips and Recommendations

- Wear reef shoes for safe entry and exit over rocky terrain
- Bring an underwater camera for spectacular wreck photography
- Look for seahorses on the wreck's structure and nearby coral
- Explore both inside and outside the tugboat's hull
- Perfect site for practicing underwater photography skills
- Consider multiple visits to appreciate different aspects of the site

## Safety Considerations

The Tugboat is considered one of Curaçao's safest dive sites due to its shallow depth and calm conditions. The rocky entry requires careful movement to avoid slips or cuts. The wreck structure should be explored carefully to avoid entanglement or damage to marine growth. Weather conditions rarely affect this protected site. The shallow depth means minimal decompression concerns, making it ideal for training and nervous divers. Emergency services are accessible through nearby facilities and the developed Caracasbaai area.

## Photography

The Tugboat offers exceptional underwater photography opportunities with its photogenic wreck structure and abundant marine life. The shallow depth provides excellent natural lighting for photography without the need for extensive artificial lighting. The schools of glassey sweepers inside the hull create spectacular wide-angle compositions. The colorful marine growth covering the wreck provides excellent macro photography subjects. The site is perfect for practicing underwater photography techniques and experimenting with different compositions and lighting approaches.
