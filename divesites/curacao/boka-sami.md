Eagle rays are commonly sighted, particularly in the deeper areas near the drop-off. The healthy coral formations host numerous species of tropical fish including parrotfish, angelfish, butterflyfish, and wrasses. Schools of blue tangs, sergeant majors, and chromis create spectacular underwater scenes. The deeper areas attract larger species including groupers, snappers, and occasional nurse sharks. Macro enthusiasts will find abundant subjects including Christmas tree worms, flamingo tongues, and diverse crustaceans.

## Dive Profile

The dive begins from a rocky shoreline in shallow water (3-6 meters), making it accessible for beginners and ideal for training dives. The reef features a gentle slope that gradually deepens, providing excellent multi-level diving opportunities. The main reef area at 10-25 meters offers diverse coral formations and abundant marine life. Advanced divers can explore the dramatic drop-off that descends to 45+ meters, where larger pelagic species are often encountered. The varied topography allows for different dive profiles depending on experience level and interests, from shallow coral garden exploration to deep wall diving.

## Entry and Exit

Entry is from a rocky coastline area requiring careful footing and appropriate footwear. Reef shoes or sturdy booties are essential for safe entry and exit. The entry point has coral rubble and rock formations that require careful navigation. Wade out slowly until you can float comfortably before putting on fins. The rocky substrate transitions to sandy areas before reaching the coral reef. Exit requires the same careful attention to the rocky shoreline conditions. The site's accessibility makes it popular, but facilities are limited.

## Tips and Recommendations

- Wear protective reef shoes for safe rocky entry and exit
- Bring all necessary equipment as facilities are minimal
- Plan dive profiles appropriate for your certification level
- Take advantage of the excellent visibility for underwater photography
- Respect the marine life, especially during turtle encounters
- Consider multiple dives to explore different depth ranges

## Safety Considerations

Boka Sami is generally considered safe for divers of appropriate skill levels. The rocky entry requires careful movement to avoid injuries. The deep drop-off areas require proper depth monitoring and buoyancy control. Weather conditions can affect entry and exit safety, so check forecasts before diving. The remote location means limited immediate access to emergency services. Always dive with a buddy and follow conservative diving practices. Surface intervals should account for the rocky exit conditions and limited shade.

## Photography

Boka Sami offers excellent underwater photography opportunities with its diverse marine life and coral formations. The frequent turtle encounters provide spectacular wide-angle photographic opportunities. The healthy coral formations offer colorful subjects for reef photography. The varied topography from shallow gardens to deep walls provides diverse compositional opportunities. Macro photography reveals abundant small subjects hiding in the coral formations. The excellent visibility and natural lighting create ideal conditions for underwater imaging.
