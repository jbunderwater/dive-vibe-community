## Marine Life

Playa Lagun is famous throughout the Caribbean for its exceptional sea turtle encounters, with both green sea turtles and hawksbill turtles regularly observed grazing in the seagrass beds and resting on the sandy bottom. The site's reputation for turtle sightings draws divers from around the world, and encounters are almost guaranteed on most dives. Beyond turtles, the healthy reef system supports diverse marine life including moray eels, octopus, southern stingrays, and schools of tropical fish. The calm protected waters and abundant food sources create an ideal environment for juvenile marine life, making it excellent for observing fish behavior and feeding patterns.

## Dive Profile

The dive begins from a small sandy beach in very shallow water (1-2 meters), making it ideal for beginners and underwater photographers. The reef starts immediately offshore with interesting coral formations beginning at depths of 3-5 meters. The bay gradually deepens toward the mouth, reaching maximum depths of 25-30 meters for more experienced divers. The compact size of the bay allows for thorough exploration during a single dive, with excellent marine life encounters at all depths. The protected nature of the cove ensures calm conditions suitable for extended underwater time and relaxed exploration.

## Entry and Exit

Entry is extremely convenient from the small sandy beach, with easy access and minimal obstacles. The entry area is sandy with good footing, making it suitable for all experience levels including those carrying camera equipment. Wade out gradually until you can float comfortably before putting on fins. The compact bay means the entry and exit point is easily located throughout the dive. The protected location ensures calm entry and exit conditions year-round, making it ideal for training dives and nervous divers.

## Tips and Recommendations

- Arrive early for the best turtle encounters and fewer crowds
- Bring an underwater camera for turtle photography opportunities
- Move slowly and calmly to avoid disturbing marine life
- Respect turtle resting areas and maintain appropriate distances
- Consider multiple dives to fully appreciate the site's offerings
- Pack snacks and water as facilities are basic but charming

## Safety Considerations

Playa Lagun is considered one of Curaçao's safest dive sites due to its protected location and calm conditions. The shallow entry and close proximity to shore provide additional safety margins. Weather conditions rarely affect this sheltered cove. Be mindful of other divers and snorkelers, as the site can become crowded during peak times. The narrow bay mouth can experience mild currents during tidal changes. Always dive with a buddy and practice respectful wildlife interaction, especially around sea turtles.

## Photography

Playa Lagun offers world-class opportunities for underwater photography, particularly for capturing sea turtle encounters. The excellent visibility and calm conditions create ideal circumstances for both wide-angle and macro photography. The frequent turtle sightings provide opportunities for natural behavior photography and close-up encounters.

The clear water and good natural lighting minimize the need for extensive artificial lighting equipment.
