The site features a gentle sloping reef with diverse coral formations and abundant marine life typical of Curaçao's healthy reef systems. Snake Bay is known for its reliable calm conditions, making it suitable for divers of all experience levels and particularly popular for training dives and underwater photography.

## Marine Life

Snake Bay supports diverse Caribbean marine life with the added excitement of occasional pelagic encounters. The site is famous for wild dolphin sightings, with bottlenose dolphins occasionally interacting with divers. Regular marine life includes green sea turtles, hawksbill turtles, and southern stingrays. The healthy coral reef hosts numerous species of tropical fish including large schools of blue tangs, sergeant majors, and chromis. The site is particularly known for its abundant fish life, with frequent "traffic jams" of schooling fish creating spectacular underwater scenes. Macro enthusiasts will find Christmas tree worms, flamingo tongues, and various crustaceans.

## Dive Profile

The dive begins from a rocky shoreline in shallow water (2-3 meters), with the reef extending directly offshore. The site features a gentle slope from shallow coral gardens to deeper reef areas reaching 30-45 meters for experienced divers. The diverse topography includes coral formations, sandy patches, and rocky areas providing varied habitats. The large reef area allows for extended exploration with interesting marine life at all depths. The gentle slope makes it ideal for multi-level diving profiles and gradual ascents.

## Entry and Exit

Entry is from a rocky coastline area requiring careful footing and sturdy reef shoes. The entry point has some coral rubble and rock formations, so careful movement is essential. Wade out slowly until you can float comfortably before putting on fins. The rocky substrate continues underwater initially, transitioning to coral reef formations. Exit requires the same careful attention to the rocky shoreline. The remote location means limited facilities, so divers should be self-sufficient.

## Tips and Recommendations

- Wear sturdy reef shoes for the rocky entry and exit
- Bring all necessary supplies as facilities are very limited
- Visit during calm weather for best entry/exit conditions
- Keep an eye out for dolphin encounters and behave respectfully if they appear
- Combine with nearby Boka Sami for a full day of diving
- Practice Leave No Trace principles in this pristine environment

## Safety Considerations

Snake Bay is generally safe but requires careful entry and exit due to the rocky shoreline. The remote location means limited immediate access to emergency services, requiring conservative diving practices. Weather conditions can affect entry/exit safety, so check forecasts carefully. The lack of facilities means divers should bring all safety equipment and emergency supplies. Always dive with a buddy and inform others of diving plans. Surface intervals should be planned considering the rocky exit requirements.

## Photography

Snake Bay offers excellent underwater photography opportunities with its diverse marine life and healthy coral formations. The abundant schooling fish provide spectacular wide-angle subjects, while the healthy reef offers numerous macro opportunities. The site is particularly good for capturing natural fish behavior and coral formations. The occasional dolphin encounters, when they occur, provide once-in-a-lifetime photographic opportunities. The clear water and good natural lighting create ideal conditions for underwater photography.
